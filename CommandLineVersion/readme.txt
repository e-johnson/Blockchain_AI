This is the command line version that I have been working on to create a functioning loan approval model at the blockchain layer.  This model works and should be augmented to be used on our actual prototype.  

Thoughts moving forward.  We need a default wallet that can have loan repayments sent to.  During this process we may actually find the need for a "smart contract" style of loan model.

Since we are currently using proof of Work for this prototype, we may have "stakers" sending money to this wallet in addition to the loan repayments.  So long as the account holds a balance we can distribute loans.
